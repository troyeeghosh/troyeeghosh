## 💼 Professional Experience & Research Projects

### Research Consultant — CEGIS (Jan 2022 – Present)  
- Conduct morphological and hydro-morphological studies: erosion–accretion prediction, bankline change detection, and riverbank delineation  
- Perform GIS-based satellite image interpretation, spatial data generation, and map preparation using ArcGIS and QGIS  
- Lead Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) for coastal water management projects  
- Prepare technical reports for dredging feasibility, river navigation planning, and environmental management  
- Support field investigations integrating primary and secondary data from surveys and site visits  

### Key Projects

- **Integrated Morphological and Hydrological Analysis of River Systems (2022–2024)**  
  Morphological studies of major rivers and inland navigation routes including Kutubdia and Matarbari Islands. Created morphological maps and dredging volume estimates. Supported Bangladesh’s national river information system through remote sensing and field data integration.

- **Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for Coastal Water Management (2023–2024)**  
  Led ESIA for water resource projects on Hatiya, Kutubdia, and Matarbari Islands. Conducted shoreline change detection and erosion vulnerability assessments to develop climate-resilient polder and greenbelt plans.

- **Landslide Risk Mapping & Strategic Planning for Hill Road Networks (2023)**  
  Developed landslide susceptibility maps and mitigation strategies for road networks in the hill districts of Rangamati, Khagrachari, and Bandarban using terrain and hydrological data.

- **Reliability Analysis of Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting (2022)**  
  Conducted B.Sc. thesis research analyzing RRWH system reliability for an educational institute, focusing on water balance modeling and supply reliability.
